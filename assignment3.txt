Part A: Come up with a T9 decoder using dictionary.

Your program should have these functionalities
- take input from user
    - e to encode
    - d to decode
    - x to exit

For decoding purposes, your program should look thru a dictionary to see if a original
string is mapped to an encoded string. If not, print "unable to decode". If there are multiple words mapped to the
same encoding, randomly select a word.

After the user encodes a string, add it to the dictionary.
You will need to read from a file to populate the dictionary.

    Here's how to print from a file:

        def read_file(file):
            file.open("file_name.txt")
            for line in file:
                print(line)
            file.close()


Part B: Form a group of 2 to 4 people and come up with a project idea. Write your project proposal like this...
Figure out who are your developers and project manager and make a list of 5 project choices. Only turn in
1 copy of the proposal per group. Turn this in NO LATER THAN JULY 26 2020!

Email me the proposal in addition to turning it in on github: alanngo673@gmail.com
